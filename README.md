  This project was created as a part of the course "MTB - Project in interactive media" at Södertörn University 2014.

The purpose of the project is to develop an easier platform for psychiatrist and healthcare personnel from which forms can be sent to the patients. The personnel chooses which types of forms the patient is to receive and sends the patient an email with the link to the forms.
The patient fills in the forms and sends it back to the system. The system analyses the results and provide the caretakers a picture of the patients’ health. This information is then available for export to the patients’ journal. (For the ease of this project this will be a regular txt file)

The goal is not to have a functioning product in the end since we won't be able to fill the security requirements for handling the patients’ personal data. But rather as a fully functioning prototype over the information flow and give users an idea of how the workflow could be.

This is Axel's first commit.
